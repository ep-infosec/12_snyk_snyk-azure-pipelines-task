## Overview

This task allows you to easily run Snyk scans within your Azure Pipeline jobs. You will need to first [create a Snyk account](https://snyk.io/login).
There are two major options:

- Snyk scan for application dependencies. This will look at manifest files.
- Snyk scan for container images. This will look at Docker images.

In addition to running a Snyk security scan, you also have the option to monitor your application / container, in which case the dependency tree or container image metadata will be posted to your Snyk account for ongoing monitoring.
